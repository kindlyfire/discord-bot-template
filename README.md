# Discord Bot Template

This is a template to build Discord bots in TypeScript. It includes a basic command handling class and loads configuration from a `.env` file.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the ZIP of this repository as the base for your bot. You can then go on and run `npm install` to install all modules. Please use [ttypescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttypescript/v/1.0.11) to compile the TypeScript files.

## Contributing

I'm not really looking for external contributions on this project as it is my personal template for Discord bots. That said, if you have anything interesting to propose, feel free to reach out to `kindly#0001` on the support server of my Quarko bot ([invite](https://discord.gg/f4f9EpY)).
